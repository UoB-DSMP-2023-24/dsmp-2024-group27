About the question givers:
- They deal with a large variety of problem statements

The larger business problem:
- LBG generates large volumes of transactional data

What do you think LBG SHOULD be doing with that transactional data:
- Ethics are super important
- It's not about just making lots of money, they care about the ethics

Things to consider in the question:
- What benefits
- What's the impact if it goes wrong
- What in the data backs this up
- How would you implement this

Data is artificially generate via simulations, NOT randomly generated. Two data drops, first one is already dropped, second is dropped shortly after the midpoint presentations.

The first dataset:
- Larger
- Clearer
- More agents
## Questions
### Ethical Considerations
- Can external data be used to help inform what we are seeing:
	- Yes it definitely can be used
	- Consider the source and the reliability when weighting data
	- Always bring back to customer data
	- The data used has a time period associated with it
	- The data is set in the future to be clear it's fake
- Ethical considerations and guidelines?
	- Should be customer centric
	- Mostly common sense
	- The industry is highly regulated
	- Clear features that can't be used, Age, Race, Gender
- What does the bank do when it finds fraud?
	- If you come up with a fraud model, they are going to ask, what are you going to do?
	- There isn't a single "what they'll always do"
	- They first ask if it's a fraud case
	- Imagine if it wasn't fraud, and you acted as if it was fraud
	- First step is usually to phone the customer to ask what's happening
	- If you block a customer from operating, it may be there only current account
	- Best to bring the customer to the discussion
	- Consider the diversity of your customers
	- BEST TO RESEARCH LLOYDS, WHEN THEY DO BUSINESS THEY DO THIS TOO
- Second data set
	- additional two columns:
		- Balance
		- Timestamp
	- Don't need to use both datasets, but it is encouraged.
	- The simulations are separate, based on different math
	- Can't directly match, there is overlapping behaviour 
- MAIN NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
	- When you can't explain why something is happening

Key Date: Formative Assessment
- Presentation
	- Progress So Far
	- Plots
	- Challenges
- What to do prior:
	- Figure out what problem to solve/research
		- Primary research, surveys on what needs to study
		- Field of study research to find, biggest issues in banking
		- Group To Do:
			- Read about problem areas in banking
			- Read research papers about problems in the area
			- Come to a conclusion on what problem is worth solving in the area
	- Research the problem statement, the field of study
	-
